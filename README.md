# The Interactive Companion Planting Map

Here is the code behind [The Interactive Companion Planting Map](https://mjsw.io/plantmap), a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application for permaculturists and gardeners of all types and levels. It's a dynamic, network-based representation of many common plants found in gardens, as well as their respective effects on each other, where known.

## The Explore tab

The only tab in production right now. It contains the network itself, and a few ways to access various plant properties, such as plant type, maximum height and links to further information.
